            <h2>Arguing For PC</h2>
            <p>I personally prefer PC because you can literally do a 
                lot of things on a PC. Keyboards and monitors are way 
                more comfortable for me. I feel in control, and I can 
                really steer the course of my games. Gaming on a PC 
                offers much more than consoles, which makes PC the 
                obvious winner. 
            </p>
          <br>
          <h3>HERE ARE 5 THINGS WHY</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Graphics and Performance</li>
            <p>PC gaming completely takes the cake here.
            I mean the power, the graphics, the performance. 
            PCs can deliver insane visuals, higher resolution, 
            and really nice frame rates, offering a 
            smooth gaming experience. Just imagine 
            playing your game with such incredible detail!
            </p>
            <li>Upgradability and Customization</li>
            <p>Unlike those consoles, where you really need to 
              spend a dime just to upgrade for the next generation, 
              PCs are all about growth. You can start from the basics 
              and gradually upgrade your graphics card, RAM, and 
              processor to ensure your system stays at the cutting 
              edge of technology. Plus, you can choose your own 
              aesthetics, from keyboards to mice and monitors, making 
              your gaming experience truly unique to you. Consoles 
              just can't match these levels of personalization.
            </p>
            <li>Endless Games</li>
            <p>
              PC gaming boasts a massive library 
              that consoles can only dream of. We're talking 
              about the number of games you can play, from classics 
              to the latest releases. You can expand your adventure 
              in this universe of endless games.
            </p>
            <li>Multitasking</li>
            <p>Why limit yourself to gaming alone? PCs are versatile 
              machines that let you multitask. I mean, PCs are more 
              than just gaming devices.
            </p>
            <li>Online</li>
            <p>Gaming isn't just about enjoying games alone. 
              PCs offer gaming communities and a ton of dedicated 
              servers. Additionally, you have a broad range of 
              multiplayer options, which I usually enjoy with my friends.
            </p>

            <p>In conclusion, I don't hate consoles; I think they're 
              better in their own way, and they're fun as well! But 
              nothing beats PC gaming. PCs are like the father, and 
              consoles are just the son. PCs offer a lot of things 
              that consoles don't have. I would say this isn't even 
              a debate; it's obvious. Come on!

                <h2>Arguing For Console</h2>
                <p> Through out the history of gaming there has been 
                  a long debate about which is better a gaming console 
                  or a pc ,but for me I would prefer using a console 
                  because of how simple it is to use and the fact 
                  that it's designed specifically for gaming.

              <h3>So here are Five resons why gaming on a gaming consolse is better than gaming on a pc:</h3>
    
              <ul>
                <li> Simplicity and Accessibility:</li>
                <p>Consoles are designed to be easier to use. You just plug it in, insert the game, and you're good to go.
                </p>
                <li> Consistent Performance:</li>
                <p> Consoles have fixed hardware, which help game developers creat a game that runs smoothly on that specific configuration. 
                </p>
                <li>Exclusives:</li>
                <p> Consoles often have exclusive games that you can't play on PC. These exclusives can be a major selling point for console enthusiasts.
                </p>
                <li>Cost:</li>
                <p>While high-end gaming PCs can be quite expensive, consoles are often more budget-friendly. 
                </p>
                <li> Local Multiplayer Experience:</li>
                <p>Consoles are known for their focus on local multiplayer gaming. They often come with multiple controllers right out of the box, making it easy for friends and family to join in.
                </p>
    
                <p>In conclution,those five factors shows how consoles are better with games
                   than a pc because of how it could benifit the user more by making it 
                   easier to use, understand, accesses and it also has more opitions for any age, which makes consoles better.
